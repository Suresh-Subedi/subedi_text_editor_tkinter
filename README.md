# Subedi Text Editor (Tkinter version)

# Note
Place Python file and icon file in the same directory and run the python file.

## About
This is a simple text editor I implemented in Python3 and Tkinter. I invested quite a time in it and since I don't work on it that much anymore, I wanted to provide access to it to people interested in it. It's themed, making it more beautiful than only using tkinter. I have tried to implement rectangular text selection with some success. It can indent text and makes it easy to write html. You can append ````<br/>```` tag after each line. You can for example select few lines of text and convert it to an ````<ul>```` or an ````<ol>````, you can apply tags to selected text from dropdown list. Or you can insert tag in cursorposition. Cursor is correctly positioned between tags. So, you don't have to place it manually.
If you use it, expand it, I'd like to hear from you, view your results, or you can submit patches.
## Why?
Tkinter Text is a fun to use widget. It is simple and yet very powerful. An experimental web browser was implemented in it. And my taste is difficult to satisfy, I guess. Other text editors just don't do it. It has to be mine.
